"Capture of tobacco use among population-based registries: Findings from 10 National Program of Cancer Registries states",,"Siegel D.A., Henley S.J., Wike J.M., Ryerson A.B., Johnson C.J., Rees J.R., Pollack L.A.","Cancer (2018) 124:11 (2381-2389). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2018","BACKGROUND: Tobacco use data are important when the epidemiology and prognosis of tobacco-associated cancers are being defined. Central cancer registries in 10 National Program of Cancer Registries states pilot-tested the collection of standardized tobacco use variables. This study evaluated the capture of tobacco use data and examined smoking prevalence among cancer patients. METHODS: Participating registries collected data about the use of tobacco—cigarettes, other smoked tobacco, and smokeless tobacco—for cases diagnosed during 2011-2013. The percentage of cases with known tobacco variable values was calculated, and the prevalence of tobacco use was analyzed by the primary cancer site and state. RESULTS: Among 1,646,505 incident cancer cases, 51% had known cigarette use data: 18% were current users, 31% were former users, and 51% reported never using. The percentage of cases with a known status for both other smoked tobacco and smokeless tobacco was 43%, with 97% and 98% coded as never users, respectively. The percent known for cigarette use ranged from 27% to 81% by state and improved from 47% in 2011 to 59% in 2013 for all 10 states combined. The percent known for cigarette use and the prevalence of ever smoking cigarettes were highest for laryngeal cancer and tracheal, lung, and bronchus cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer registrars ascertained cigarette use for slightly more than half of all new cancer cases, but other tobacco-related fields were less complete. Studies to evaluate the validity of specific tobacco-related variables and the ability of cancer registries to capture this information from the medical record are needed to gauge the usefulness of collecting these variables through cancer surveillance systems.

"Nicotine abstinence of cancer patients before, during andafter treatment",,"Laack E.","Onkologie (2011) 34 SUPPL. 6 (100-101). Date of Publication: September 2011","Tobacco use accounts for at least 25% of all cancer deaths including carcinomaof the lung, lip, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, uterine cervix, kidney, bladder and stomach.Smoking cessation is an important opportunity to enhance effectiveness ofcancer treatment, like surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy. It is importantnot only for cancer patients but also for all patients who need surgicaltherapy. Smokers have an increased mortality risk, more pulmonary and respiratorycomplications attributable to limited lung function, wound infectionsand delayed surgical wound healing. For example, in colorectal surgery, smokingpatients have a major possibility for anastomic leakage compared to nonsmokers.In breast reconstruction smoking impairs the free TRAM flapmicrocirculation. In Liver transplant, smoking is associated with more cardiovascular-related and sepsis-specific mortality and vascular complications andhigher incidence of ascites and encephalopathy. Smoking cessation shortlybefore thoracic surgery is associated with improved long-term survival.Tobacco smoking during radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer isassociated with unfavourable outcome. Current smoker with lung cancer duringradiotherapy have a 20% greater probability of radiation pneumonitis.During chemotherapy, smoking exacerbates oral mucosites, loss of tase, xerostomia, weight loss and fatigue.Tobacco smoking after cancer diagnosis has also a negative impact on prognosis(e.g. small cell lung cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, Non-Hodgkin'slymphoma, breats cancer) as well as on quality of life.Therefore, physicians should motivate and help their cancer patients to quitsmoking as soon as possible before cancer treatment. Non-smoking is not onlycool, it also enhance effectiveness of cancer treatment and had a positiveimpact on survival.Every comprehensive cancer center should offer cancer patients and also thecommunity as a whole a service of smoking cessation and also promotetobacco control in adolescents and adults.

"Molecular Marker as a Prognostic Indicator in Head and Neck Cancer Patients",,"Kirthi Koushik A., Sandeep K., Rahul D., Alva R.C.","Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology (2019) 10:1 (162-166). Date of Publication: 6 Mar 2019","Head and neck cancer forms the major burden of cancer in the developing countries. Despite advancement in the treatment approach of head and neck cancer in terms of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy overall long-term survival remains low due to uncontrollable persistent and recurrent disease. This low survival rate has demanded for the need for newer treatment approaches and prognostic markers. In a previously published study “impact of molecular predictors on the response rates in head and neck Cancer patients” by Koushik et al. assessed the impact of molecular markers like HPV, P53, and EGFR status along with other prognostic factors like tobacco use, age, sex, and socioeconomic status on response to treatment of head and neck cancer patients. Our present study is intent to provide update of the impact of those molecular markers on survival. Objective of our study is to correlate the HPV, EGFR, and P53 status with the survival rate of the head and neck cancer patients. Twenty-five histologically proven head and neck cancer patients were assessed for HPV, EGFR, and P53 status who underwent chemoradiation to a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fraction along with weekly cisplatin of 40 mg/m(2), and all treated patients were followed up to a minimum of 3 years and analyzed for the survival. We found that 3-year survival for complete responders after treatment is 61.5% and partial responders, 57.1%; stable disease is 33.3%, and progressive disease is 0%. A 3-year survival for HPV-positive patients is 57.4% (p = 0.973), EGFR-mutated patients is 47.62% (p = 0.593), and P53-mutated patients is 57.89% (p = 0.378).",,

Date of Publication: Oct. 2011","The association of education, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and interleukin-2 (IL-2 +114 and -384) and -6 (IL-6 -174) DNA polymorphisms with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) was investigated in a cohort study of 445 subjects. IL-2 and IL-6 genotypes were determined by real-time PCR. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of disease-specific survival according to anatomical sites of the head and neck. Mean age was 56 years and most patients were males (87.6%). Subjects with 5 or more years of schooling had better survival in larynx cancer. Smoking had no effect on HNSCC survival, but alcohol consumption had a statistically significant effect on larynx cancer. IL-2 gene +114 G/T (HR = 0.52; 95%CI = 0.15-1.81) and T/T (HR = 0.22; 95%CI = 0.02-3.19) genotypes were associated with better survival in hypopharynx cancer. IL-2 +114 G/T was a predictor of poor survival in oral cavity/oropharynx cancer and larynx cancer (HR = 1.32; 95%CI = 0.61-2.85). IL-2 -384 G/T was associated with better survival in oral cavity/oropharynx cancer (HR = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.45-1.42) and hypopharynx cancer (HR = 0.68; 95%CI = 0.21-2.20), but an inverse relationship was observed for larynx cancer. IL-6 -174 G/C was associated with better survival in hypopharynx cancer (HR = 0.68; 95%CI = 0.26-1.78) and larynx cancer (HR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.42-2.07), and C/C reduced mortality in larynx cancer. In general, our results are similar to previous reports on the value of education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and IL-2 and IL-6 genetic polymorphisms for the prognosis of HNSCC, but the risks due to these variables are small and estimates imprecise.",,

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2015","Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether demographics, lifestyle habits, clinical data and alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphisms rs1229984 and rs1573496 associated with first primary head and neck (HNC) are associated with overall survival, recurrence, and second primary cancer (SPC). Methods: We conducted a follow-up study in five centres including 801 cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for overall survival, recurrence and SPC. Results: Five-years overall survival was 62% for HNC cases, 55% for oral cavity, 53% for oropharynx, 41% for hypopharynx, and 71% for larynx. Predictors of survival were older ages (HR. =. 1.18 for 5 years increase; CI: 1.07-1.30), higher tumour stage (HR. =. 4.16; CI: 2.49-6.96), and high alcohol consumption (HR. =. 3.93; CI: 1.79-8.63). A combined therapy (HR. =. 3.29; CI: 1.18-9.13) was associated with a worst prognosis for oral cavity cancer. The only predictor was higher tumour stage (HR. =. 2.25; CI: 1.26-4.03) for recurrence, and duration of smoking (HR. =. 1.91; CI: 1.00-3.68) for SPC. ADH1B rs1229984 polymorphism HRs for HNC and oesophageal cancer death and for alcohol related cancer death were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.42-1.08), and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.40-1.03), respectively. Conclusions: The survival expectation differs among HNC sites. Increasing age and stage, and high alcohol consumption were unfavourable predictors of HNC survival overall. Duration of tobacco consumption before the first primary tumour was a risk factor for SPC.",,
"Salivary tumor markers for oral and oropharyngeal cancer",,"Nagler R.","Anticancer Research (2014) 34:10 (6076). Date of Publication: October 2014","Introduction: Follow-up of patients who have undergone treatment for oral cancer (oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) is done routinely and often in order to detect recurrences soon after they occur. The development of salivary diagnostic tools for these patients is of paramount importance, especially for high-risk populations (patients with pre-malignant lesions, “cured” patients, patients with previous history of cancer in general, tobacco and alcohol consumers and others). Home testing kits would further facilitate salivary testing as a diagnostic aid, enabling patients, especially those who live far from their treatment centers, to monitor their own health at home. Results: In various studies performed during the passing 15 years we found that salivary 'tools' are those focused on measuring changes of specific salivary macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids (as fatty acids are rather scarce in saliva), i.e. examining genomic or proteomic targets, such as enzymes, cytokines, growth factors, metalloproteinases, endothelin, telomerase, cyto -keratines, mRNA's, DNA aberrations, etc. Hence, saliva testing, a non-invasive alternative to serum testing, may be an effective modality for diagnosis and for prognosis prediction of oral cancer, as well as for monitoring post therapy status, by measuring specific salivary macromolecules. Salivary analysis has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool also for distant malignancies, such as breast cancer. In recent years, significant alterations have been demonstrated in the saliva of oral cancer patients in the epithelial tumor markers - Cyfra 21-1, TPS and CA12, various oxidative stress-related salivary parameters as ROS and RNS, biochemical and immunological parameters as IGF and MMP's and various other RNA transcripts. Discussion: Salivary analysis is predicted to alter the field of oral cancer diagnosis by employing highly sensitive new tools enabling both medical professionals and the patients themselves to monitor their saliva for diagnosis and prognosis prediction.",,
