"Characteristics of lung cancer after a previous malignancy",,"Reinmuth N., Stumpf P., Stumpf A., Muley T., Kobinger S., Hoffmann H., Herth F.J.F., Schnabel P.A., Bischoff H., Thomas M.","Respiratory Medicine (2014) 108:6 (910-917). Date of Publication: June 2014","Background In the era of improving overall survival rates of malignant diseases, the impact of a previous malignancy (PM) on treatment and outcome of lung cancer (LC) remains unclear. Methods We reviewed all LC patients from our institution that were treated from 2004 to 2006 for the occurrence of LC with PM excluding patients with multiple primary LC. Results A total of 444 and 2698 LC patients with and without a history of a PM were identified (prevalence of 14.1%). PM were most often located in breast (15.5%), prostate (14.9%), bladder (9.0%) and kidney (8.8%). Compared to never smokers, patients with nicotine consumption had more often a cancer history of prostate, gastrointestinal, and the head-neck region. The median interval until diagnosis of LC was 72.2 months (range 0-537 months) with most LC diagnosed 5 years after PM diagnosis. With a similar distribution of histology, stage and localization compared to controls, NSCLC patients with PM and stage IV disease showed a favorable overall survival (p < 0.0001). In contrast, SCLC patients had similar survival curves (n.s.). Conclusions A considerable subgroup of LC patients has a history of PM that may indicate a favorable prognostic factor. However, these patients should be treated similar to other LC patients. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,

Date of Publication: 1 May 2017","Purpose or Objective Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is a well-defined disease typically affecting young to middle-aged male nonsmokers. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers is rapidly increasing in most Western countries, but detailed epidemiological data are not available for the Dusseldorf population. Moreover, among other head and neck regions, a less significant proportion of oral highgrade dysplasia and cancers appears to depend on HPV infection, whereas its role in laryngeal cancer is recognized as less significant. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence and clinical outcome of HPV infection in different head neck cancer patients in a German population. Material and Methods In this retrospective study, the tumour tissue from 164 patients (110 men, 54 women, 62.8 years + 12.7) with head neck cancer (oropharynx = 65 nasopharynx = 10, larynx = 13, hypopharynx = 15, oral cavity = 33 CUP = 5, Other = 23) were tested for HPV infection. Furthermore, the clinical outcome for all tumor sides was examined with uni and multivariate analysis. We analyzed p16 in all tumor tissues as a surrogate marker for HPV infection with immunohistochemistry. Moreover, risk factors such as nicotine, alcohol abuse, location of the tumour, resection margin of the tumour tissue, histology, lymph nodes involvement, extracapsular spread, tumour stage, and the treatment of the tumour (surgery, chemo and radiation therapy) were examined for local tumour control and overall survival for all patients. Results The prevalence of HPV infection in oropharynx-carcinoma patients in Dusseldorf was 33%. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas showed a tendency towards longer survival time, (p = 0.76, HR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.91 - 6.44) compared to HPV-negative tumours. This association was independent from alcohol and nicotine abuse. Other tumour locations like larynx or hypopharynx carcinoma showed no association between HPV infection and clinical outcome. As expected the tumour stage in all tumour locations was significant in the uni and multivariate analysis for local control and overall survival. Conclusion The HPV infection in Dusseldorf was lower than anticipated. Furthermore, in our study it seems that p 16 positive oropharyngeal carcinoma patients have a better clinical outcome than p 16 negative patients. In this patient group p 16 can be used as a prognostic biomarker. This was independent from alcohol and nicotine abuse. But for other tumor localizations we could not find a better clinical outcome.",,
"Longitudinal self-reported and serum-based assessment of tobacco or nicotine use in head and neck cancer patients during definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy",,"Kudrimoti M.R., Arnold S.M., Valentino J., Randall M., Warren G.W.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010) 28:15 SUPPL. 1. Date of Publication: 20 May 2010","Background: Tobacco use during cancer treatment is associated with a poor prognosis, but tobacco or nicotine use (TNU) assessment in cancer treatment patients is poorly characterized. Methods: Patients with measurable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were eligible for enrollment. Entry and weekly self-reported TNU was measured in combination with objective serum cotinine (SC, an established quantitative measure of TNU). Results: At interim analysis, 50 patients are enrolled and SC assessments are complete for 37 patients. Of 37 patients, 81% are male (median age at diagnosis 53, range 39-75), 68% have oropharyngeal tumors, 84% are node positive, 81% presented at stage III-IVB, and 89% were treated with CRT. Any tobacco use was reported in 78% (median pack-year history of 32.5, range 3-138). Successful tobacco cessation was reported in 54% with 1-3 years median duration (range 2 wks to 40 yrs). At diagnosis, 30% of patients reported TNU; however, 41% of patients were SC positive at some time throughout RT or CRT. Of 30% of patients reporting second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure, 45% denied TNU at study entry. Of 19% of patients reporting social help with cessation, 71% reported that a friend or family helped and only 29% reported that doctors helped. SC values varied widely in individual patients over the course of RT or CRT. Of 41% of SC positive patients, 93% were SC positive at study entry, 73% at mid-treatment (week 4), and 53% during the final week of treatment. Conclusions: Data demonstrate that most HNSCC patients presenting with TNU at the beginning of RT or CRT continue TNU throughout treatment. Multiple TNU and SHS assessments are necessary to accurately characterize TNU during cancer treatment and the effects on clinical outcome.",,

"CGP1 mediated inflammasome activation and metastasis in OSCC",,"Wu C.-S., Chang Y.-S.","Anticancer Research (2014) 34:10 (6246). Date of Publication: October 2014","Worldwide, oral cancer is one of a prevalent malignant neoplasm leading to death, yet its molecular pathogenesis is unclear. Inflammasome activity has been reported that is involved in tumorigenesis in many kinds of human cancers. CGP1 is a key adaptor protein mediating the activation of inflammasome. In this study, we identified that the inflammasome activity was elevated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines by DNA, RNA and bacteria stimulation but not by known risk factors of OSCC progression, such as nicotine and arecoline. In previous studies it was shown that CGP1 has a tumor suppressor function in a variety of human cancers. However, in our study, we found that the CGP1mRNA and protein level of CGP1 were both up-regulated in the tumor region but not in adjacent healthy regions of OSCC patients. According to IHC scoring result, we analyzed the relationship between highly expressed CGP1 and clinicopathological characteristic of OSCC. Over-expressed CGP1 was correlated with tumor stage (p=0.001), node stage (p<0.001), overall stage (p<0.001) and extracapsular spread (p<0.001) in OSCC patients. We further analyzed the clinical outcome of over-expressed CGP1. The results indicated that CGP1 was a risk factor for poor prognosis. In an in vitro study, the migration and invasion ability were both increased in over-expressed CGP1 cell lines. In an in vivo study, cells over-expressing CGP1 were injected into mouse tongue resulting in lymph node metastasis around the cervical region. The survival rate was lower in mouse injected with CGP1 expressing cells than in vector control cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that CGP1 mediated inflammasome activation and played an oncogenetic role in OSCC.",,
"Smoking and gut",,"Massarrat S.","Archives of Iranian Medicine (2008) 11:3 (293-305). Date of Publication: May 2008","Smoking has not only enormous deleterious effects on cardiovascular, cerebral, and bronchial organs but also profoundly alters the function of all parts of the gastrointestinal tract through various mechanisms. Except the sole curiously observed benefit of smoking on the course of ulcerative colitis, it increases the prevalence of the common gastrointestinal diseases namely gastroesophageal acid reflux, peptic ulcer, and Crohn's diseases. It also increases the incidence of cancer of oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and liver mostly in a dose-response relationship and worsens the prognosis of colon cancer. The cessation of smoking is associated with the reduced incidence of cancer in the reported organs, but its effect on the regression of benign disease is not generally studied. The physicians must be aware not only of the harmful effect of smoking on the cardiovascular and bronchial systems, but also about the detrimental consequences of life-long smoking on the gastrointestinal tract anal the increase of its benign and malignant diseases.",,

Date of Publication: March/April 2007","Background: Molecular events following nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation by nicotine are poorly understood. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt/PTEN pathway has been suggested to play a role in the antiapoptotic responses to nicotine. Materials and Methods: To elucidate the possible role of α3, α5 and α7 nAChR subunit mediated PI3-K/Akt/PTEN pathway activation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) development, mRNA was isolated from 30 HNSCC tissues of known Akt activation state and were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: α3, α5 and α7 nAChR subunits were expressed in 1/30 (3.33%), 15/30 (50%) and 10/30 (33.33%), respectively. These results did not correlate with pAkt levels, previously assessed in our laboratory, or any of the clinicopathological parameters considered. Conclusion: This is the first report on nAChR subunit expression in human HNSCC surgical specimens of known pAkt levels. Our results suggest that nAChRs might exert their function through pathways different from PI3-K/Akt/PTEN and that α3, α5 or α7 nAChR subunit expression might not be useful prognostic markers in HNSCC.",,
"β-Arrestin-1 expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in laryngeal carcinoma",,"Marioni G., Nicolè L., Cappellesso R., Marchese-Ragona R., Fasanaro E., Di Carlo R., La Torre F.B., Nardello E., Sanavia T., Ottaviano G., Fassina A.","International Journal of Biological Markers (2019) 34:1 (33-40). Date of Publication: 2019","Aim: The novel primary end-point of the present study was to ascertain β-arrestin-1 expression in a cohort of consecutive patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) with information available on their cigarette-smoking habits. A secondary end-point was to conduct a preliminary clinical and pathological investigation into the possible role of β-arrestin-1 in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), identified by testing for E-cadherin, Zeb1, and Zeb2 expression, in the setting of LSCC. Methods: The expression of β-arrestin-1, E-cadherin, zeb1, and zeb2 was ascertained in 20 consecutive LSCCs. Results: Statistical analysis showed no significant associations between β-arrestin-1 and EMT (based on the expression of E-cadherin, Zeb1, and Zeb2). The combined effect of nicotine and β-arrestin-1 was significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (P=0.01) in our series of LSCC. This latter result was also confirmed in an independent, publicly available LSCC cohort (P=0.047). Conclusions: Further investigations on larger series (ideally in prospective settings) are needed before we can consider closer follow-up protocols and/or more aggressive treatments for patients with LSCC and a combination of nicotine exposure and β-arrestin-1 positivity in tumor cells at the time of their diagnosis. Further studies on how β-arrestin functions in cancer via different signaling pathways might reveal potential targets for the treatment of even advanced laryngeal malignancies.",,
"Nicotine promotes lymph node metastasis and cetuximab resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma",,"Shimizu R., Ibaragi S., Eguchi T., Kuwajima D., Kodama S., Nishioka T., Okui T., Obata K., Takabatake K., Kawai H., Ono K., Okamoto K., Nagatsuka H., Sasaki A.","International Journal of Oncology (2019) 54:1 (283-294). Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2019","Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is overexpressed in many cancers and is associated with worse prognosis. EGF binds to its cell surface receptor (EGFR), which induces EGFR phosphorylation. Phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) is translocated into the nucleus, which increases cancer cell activity. Nicotine, which is one of the main components of tobacco, is absorbed through pulmonary alveoli and mucosal epithelia in the head and neck region by smoking and moves into the blood. Nicotine in blood binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the central nervous system and serves a crucial role in tobacco addiction. Although nAChR localization is thought to be limited in the nervous system, nAChR is present in a wide variety of non-neuronal cells, including cancer cells. Recent studies suggest that nicotine contributes to the metastasis and resistance to anti-cancer drugs of various cancer cells. However, it remains unknown whether head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells can utilize nicotine-nAChR signaling to metastasize and acquire resistance to anti-cancer drugs, even though the mucosal epithelia of the head and neck region are the primary sites of exposure to tobacco smoke. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the role of nicotine in metastasis and anti-EGFR-therapy resistance of HNSCC. The present findings demonstrated that nicotine increased proliferation, migration, invasion, p-EGFR nuclear translocation and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in HNSCC cells. It was also demonstrated that nicotine restored cetuximab-inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSCC cells. Finally, an in vivo experiment revealed that nicotine increased lymph node metastasis of xenografted tumors, whereas an nAChR inhibitor suppressed lymph node metastasis and p-EGFR nuclear localization of xenografted tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrated that nicotine induced nuclear accumulation of p-EGFR, and activation of Akt signaling. These signaling pathways elevated the activities of HNSCC cells, causing lymph node metastasis and serving a role in cetuximab resistance.",,

The study objective was to confirm a previous finding that patients with stage III/IV squamous head and neck cancer (SHNC) who smoke during radiotherapy (RT) experience reduced survival. Methods. An observational cohort study. Patients' smoking status was assessed weekly by questionnaire plus blood cotinine. Patients were assessed every 3 to 4 months for survival. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to detect the independent contribution of smoking on survival. Results. Of 148 patients, 113 smoked during RT. Blood cotinine and smoking questionnaire responses were highly correlated (Spearman R = .69; p < .0005). Abstainers and very light smokers experienced better survival than light, moderate, and heavy smokers (median, 42 vs 29 months; p = .07). Tumor and nodal status and years smoked were the most important prognostic factors. Smoking during RT was not an independent predictor of survival, but baseline smoking status was (p = .016). Conclusion. Smoking status should be documented in all future trials of RT in SHNC to allow for pooled analyses with sufficient power to address this question. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,
"Effects of tobacco smoking and nicotine on cancer treatment",,"Petros W.P., Younis I.R., Ford J.N., Weed S.A.","Pharmacotherapy (2012) 32:10 (920-931). Date of Publication: October 2012","A substantial number of the world's population continues to smoke tobacco, even in the setting of a cancer diagnosis. Studies have shown that patients with cancer who have a history of smoking have a worse prognosis than nonsmokers. Modulation of several physiologic processes involved in drug disposition has been associated with long-term exposure to tobacco smoke. The most common of these processes can be categorized into the effects of smoking on cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism, glucuronidation, and protein binding. Perturbation in the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs could result in clinically significant consequences, as these drugs are among the most toxic, but potentially beneficial, pharmaceuticals prescribed. Unfortunately, the effect of tobacco smoking on drug disposition has been explored for only a few marketed anticancer drugs; thus, little prescribing information is available to guide clinicians on the vast majority of these agents. The carcinogenic properties of several compounds found in tobacco smoke have been well studied; however, relatively little attention has been given to the effects of nicotine itself on cancer growth. Data that identify nicotine's effect on cancer cell apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis are emerging. The implications of these data are still unclear but may lead to important questions regarding approaches to smoking cessation in patients with cancer.",,

Date of Publication: September 2011","Tobacco use accounts for at least 25% of all cancer deaths including carcinomaof the lung, lip, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, uterine cervix, kidney, bladder and stomach.Smoking cessation is an important opportunity to enhance effectiveness ofcancer treatment, like surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy. It is importantnot only for cancer patients but also for all patients who need surgicaltherapy. Smokers have an increased mortality risk, more pulmonary and respiratorycomplications attributable to limited lung function, wound infectionsand delayed surgical wound healing. For example, in colorectal surgery, smokingpatients have a major possibility for anastomic leakage compared to nonsmokers.In breast reconstruction smoking impairs the free TRAM flapmicrocirculation. In Liver transplant, smoking is associated with more cardiovascular-related and sepsis-specific mortality and vascular complications andhigher incidence of ascites and encephalopathy. Smoking cessation shortlybefore thoracic surgery is associated with improved long-term survival.Tobacco smoking during radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer isassociated with unfavourable outcome. Current smoker with lung cancer duringradiotherapy have a 20% greater probability of radiation pneumonitis.During chemotherapy, smoking exacerbates oral mucosites, loss of tase, xerostomia, weight loss and fatigue.Tobacco smoking after cancer diagnosis has also a negative impact on prognosis(e.g. small cell lung cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, Non-Hodgkin'slymphoma, breats cancer) as well as on quality of life.Therefore, physicians should motivate and help their cancer patients to quitsmoking as soon as possible before cancer treatment. Non-smoking is not onlycool, it also enhance effectiveness of cancer treatment and had a positiveimpact on survival.Every comprehensive cancer center should offer cancer patients and also thecommunity as a whole a service of smoking cessation and also promotetobacco control in adolescents and adults.

The objective of this study was to examine the clinical, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with tobacco use in patients (pts) with SCCHN undergoing curative-intent radiotherapy (RT). Methods: Self-report questionnaires were administered to 24 pts with SCCHN undergoing curative-intent RT at Montefiore Medical Center who had reported smoking within 6 months prior to diagnosis. Data collected at baseline included demographics, smoking behaviors and attitudes, mood state using MHI-5, and quality of life (QoL) using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H & N35 questionnaires. Results: Most participants (79%) were male, 38% were married, and 70% had a high school education or less. Forty-six percent were African American and 21% were Hispanic. Most pts had oropharyngeal (33%) or laryngeal (42%) cancers, and 67% had stage IV disease. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 21.6. Average duration of tobacco use was 39.3 yrs. Eight pts (33%) reported concomitant alcohol use. Only 57% felt that smoking was somewhat or very much related to their cancer diagnosis, though 92% were in action or contemplative stages of change. Most (63%) had tried to quit at least once in their lifetime but without formal guidance; 33% had used a form of nicotine replacement. Mean MHI-5 score was 52, previously shown to correlate with depression. Pts scored lower on the social functioning scale (71.4) relative to the general head and neck cancer population (82.6). The worst symptom scale scores were pain killer use, weight loss, coughing, swallowing difficulties, and financial difficulties. Five pts (21%) did not complete RT or had treatment delays 5 days. After a median of 16 months of follow-up, 5 (21%) have died of disease and 2 (8%) are alive with recurrence. Conclusions: Active cigarette smokers with SCCHN represent a population with impaired QoL at risk for poor outcomes despite curative-intent RT. Interventions targeting community education on cancer prevention and smoking cessation and addressing QoL in smokers with SCCHN are indicated.",,

Although squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus has been more commonly diagnosed over the past 30 years, there is increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) in Western industrialized countries. In contrast there is a linear reduction of the incidence of gastric cancer. During the same time the location of gastric cancer from the distal to the upper third of the stomach changed. A linear increase of the incidence of cardia carcinoma is described. For SCC the known etiological risk factors are nicotine and alcohol abuse. For AC, they are moderate nicotine and alcohol consumption as well as gastro-esophageal reflux and obesity. Numerous environmental influences and patient related factors work over a long period of time in a complex multifactorial process together and lead to the development of gastric cancer. The obvious reduction of the incidence of this tumour during the last years in Western industrialized countries has to be noticed as an effect of relevant changes in personal habits of life and environmental conditions. Frequent consume of fresh fruits and crudités and a simultanous reduction of salt, salted food and grilled meat is recommended for the prevention of gastro-intestinal tumours.

As such a significant determinant of patient prognosis, accurate classification of current smoking status is important. Self-reported smoking status may lead to misclassification if patients conceal their true status. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of self-reported tobacco use during the previous 48 hours in head and neck cancer patients on the day of surgery. Study Design Cross-sectional. Setting Two academic medical centers in the southeastern United States. Subjects and Methods On the day of surgery, 108 head and neck cancer patients completed a survey asking about tobacco use during the past 48 hours and had semi-quantitative levels of urinary cotinine measured to biochemically validate self-reported recent smoking. Results Self-reported smoking yielded a sensitivity of 60.9% (95% CI, 45.4%-74.9%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 91.3%-100.0%). The sensitivity increased to 76.1% (95% CI, 61.2%-87.4%) when allowing for the possibility that exposure to secondhand smoke or use of nicotine-containing products could have caused a positive cotinine test. Conclusion In this patient population, self-reported recent smoking yielded a high (39%) proportion of false-negatives, and even 24% remained false-negatives after allowing for other sources of nicotine exposure. This magnitude of underreporting combined with the importance of tobacco use to patient prognosis supports the need for routinely biochemically verifying recent tobacco use in self-reported nonsmokers within the clinical setting.",,

Study Design: Retrospective review. Methods: Clinical characteristics of OPSCC patients treated between 2008 and 2015 with CCRT were abstracted from medical records. OS curves and multivariate cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were examined. Results: Of 120 evaluable patients, 71% had HPV(+) tumors. Median follow-up duration for the entire cohort was 41.5 months (range = 6–88 months). HPV(+) current smokers experienced significantly worse 5-year OS (73% alive vs. 36% alive, P =.01) and there was a similar trend in HPV(−) current smokers (66% alive vs. 31% alive, P =.28) compared to former/never smokers undergoing CCRT. In a multivariate cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, gender, and overall tumor stage, HPV(+) current smokers experienced nearly a fourfold increase in overall mortality in comparison to HPV(+) never/former smokers (HR = 3.68, 95% CI = 1.35-10.0).

Date of Publication: January 2007","Esophageal cancer can be divided in squamous-cell cancer (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (Barrett cancer: AEG I) by histopathology. However, most studies do not differentiate between these two tumor entities. SCC is associated with a lower socioeconomic level with nicotine and alcohol abuse resulting in comorbidities like liver cirrhosis and reduced pulmonary function; in contrast, AEG I is associated with a high socioeconomic level and cardiovascular risk factors. The median age of patients with SCC is 10 years younger than with AEG I. The localization of AEG I is in 94% below the tracheal bifurcation, whereas SCC has contact to the tracheal bronchial tree in 75%. Furthermore, SCC shows an earlier lymphatic spread and a worse prognosis compared to AEG I. The different localization and different comorbidities require different therapeutic strategies. The preoperative induction therapy consists of combined chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced SCC and of chemotherapy for AEG I in our department. Due to the favorable position of AEG I a classic Ivor-Lewis procedure ending with an intrathoracic anastomosis is possible, in contrast, SCC frequently requires a subtotal esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis (in a two step strategy). Therefore, at the moment there is no doubt that SCC and AEG I are two different diseases with different pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology and prognosis requiring different therapeutic strategies. We suggest that the two different tumor entities should be analyzed and reported separately to provide comparable results in the future. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,

Cancer patients are suffering from severe stress, various symptoms and disabilities, long hospital stay. This situation might motivate them quit smoking or, on the contrary, smoking ban could be an additional stress. Materials and Methods: Group for cancer patients support has been established at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia in 2007 by cancer patients and health care professionals in order to provide support to patients, advocate for their needs and improve communication with health care professionals. This group initiated the survey among patients at the Institute in order to establish cancer patients attitudes on smoking, quitting and the total ban of smoking in cancer hospitals. A one-day anonymous survey on attitudes on smoking, quitting and the total ban of smoking in hospital has been carried out among all hospitalized and daily clinic patients of the Institute for oncology and Radiology of Serbia. Results: A questionnaire was completed by 316 cancer patients. Among them, 45% were never smokers and 26% former smokers. Two thirds of patients considered smoking very harmful for health, and 75% thought it was very important for cancer patients to quit smoking. Among patients with lung, laryngeal and oral cancer the percentage of never-smokers as well as the belief in harmfulness of smoking was lower. Over 80% of all patients thought that the period of treatment at the Institute is the right moment to quit. The majority of patients supported the idea of smoking cessation courses organized for patients at the Institute. However, finally, only 49% of all patients supported the total ban of smoking at the Institute while 47% thought that rooms for smoking should be provided for patients. Conclusions: After the survey, the dilemma still remains. At the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, there is a total ban of smoking with one smoking area provided for patients. Smoking cessation courses will be organized at the Institute for patients undergoing cancer treatment and nicotine replacement therapy provided for disabled hospitalized patients not being able to quit.",,

The mean age was 40.0 years old and most suffered from an alcoholic and/or nicotine addiction. 89,6% expressed an epidermoid carcinoma and buccal cavity and larynx lesions represented the most frequent locations, followed by the pharynx. Overall survival does not differ from that of an older population but some locations seem to have a very poor prognosis: mobile tongue, vallecula, piriform sinus and amygdala. On the other hand, the laryngeal locations confirm their favorable prognosis.",,
"Predictors of long-term smoking cessation in head and neck cancer patients.",,"Gritz E.R., Carr C.R., Rapkin D., Abemayor E., Chang L.J., Wong W.K., Belin T.R., Calcaterra T., Robbins K.T., Chonkich G.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology (1993) 2:3 (261-270). Date of Publication: 1993 May-Jun","Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for head and neck cancer, and individuals who continue to smoke past diagnosis and treatment are at elevated risk for further disease. In a randomized controlled trial, a state of the art provider-delivered smoking cessation intervention was compared to a usual care advice control condition. The intervention consisted of surgeon- or dentist-delivered advice to stop smoking, a contracted quit date, tailored written materials, and booster advice sessions. Subjects were 186 patients with newly diagnosed first primary squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract who had smoked cigarettes within the past year. At randomization, 88.2% of subjects were current smokers. At 12-month follow-up, 70.2% of subjects completing the trial (n = 114) were continuous abstainers; among baseline smokers alone the continuous abstinence (CA) rate was 64.6%. The cotinine validation rate at 12 months was 89.6%. Modeling techniques were utilized in order to derive expected CA rates, which included noncompleter subjects (n = 72). The CA rate expected at 1 year for the entire patient population was 64.2%, and for smokers alone the expected CA rate was 59.4%. Logistic regression analysis carried out on baseline smokers identified predictors of 12-month CA status. These included medical treatment, stage of change, age, nicotine dependence, and race. The intervention effect was not significant, although the sign of the effect was positive. Based on these findings, we recommend systematic brief advice to stop smoking for head and neck cancer patients, with a stepped care approach for patients less able to quit.",,

Date of Publication: 15 May 2014","The tobacco-specific nitrosamines N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are potent carcinogens for the rat esophagus and lung, respectively. Consistent with the animal carcinogenicity data, we previously reported a remarkably strong association between prospectively measured urinary total NNN, a biomarker of human NNN intake, and the risk of developing esophageal cancer among smokers in the Shanghai Cohort Study. We also demonstrated that urinary total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a biomarker of exposure to the lung carcinogen NNK, is strongly associated with the risk of lung, but not esophageal cancer in smokers. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between NNN intake and lung cancer risk in the same cohort. The prospectively collected urine samples from lung cancer cases and matching controls selected for this study, all current smokers, have been previously analyzed for total NNAL, cotinine (a biomarker of nicotine intake) and phenanthrene tetraol (PheT) (a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Urinary levels of total NNN were not associated with the risk of lung cancer: odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with the second and third tertiles of total NNN, relative to the lowest tertile, were 0.82 (0.36-1.88) and 1.02 (0.39-2.89), respectively (p for trend = 0.959), after adjustment for self-reported smoking history, urinary cotinine and PheT. The results of this study reaffirm the previously reported specificity of urinary total NNN and total NNAL as predictors of esophageal and lung cancer risks, respectively, in smokers, and demonstrate remarkable coherence between rat target tissues of these carcinogens and susceptibility to cancer in smokers. © 2013 UICC.",,
"An association between chronic hyperplastic changes in the larynx and human papilloma virus infection","ZUSAMMENHANG ZWISCHEN DER CHRONISCH HYPERPLASTISCHEN LARYNGITIS UND DER INFEKTION MIT HUMANEN PAPILLOMVIREN","Arndt O., Zeise K., Bauer J., Brock J.","HNO (1993) 41:3 (123-127). Date of Publication: 1993","Cancer of the larynx is one of the most prevalent tumors of the head and neck, with its prognosis dependent on early diagnosis. A number of authors have now reported a connection between head and neck cancers and infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). A large number of these tumors has been found to be HPV 16/18 positive, with results ranging from 10% to 75% positive. It is currently known that viral infection alone cannot realize an oncogenic potential and there have to be exogenous and/or endogenous factors as well. Further, little is known about the prognosis of epithelial lesions which undergo malignant conversion. The aim of our study was to determine whether the HP 16/18 content in biopsies of chronic hyperplastic inflammations of the larynx was a prognostic factor for later malignancy. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine 150 laryngeal biopsies from 132 men and 18 women. Additionally, historical data, including information about regular alcohol and nicotine consumption, were examined for an association with HPV 16/18. Three different groups were found to be at risk for developing a carcinoma of the larynx from the 91 patients positive for HPV 16/18 (10 women and 81 men). These included: 1. HPV 16/18 positive patients not exposed to exogenous irritants (6 women and 9 men); HPV 16/18 positive smokers (1 woman and 37 men); 3. HPV 16/18 positive smokers and regular alcohol drinkers (3 women and 35 men). During the 3 1/2 years of our study one woman and one man from the first group developed a cancer of the larynx. In the second group cancer occurred in one woman and 8 men, while 4 men in the third group developed a carcinoma. In contrast, only one patient in the HPV-negative group developed a cancer.",,
"Esophageal carcinoma: Clinical presentation and diagnosis","KLINIK UND DIAGNOSE DES OSOPHAGUSKARZINOMS","Schofl R.","Acta Chirurgica Austriaca (1994) 26:2 (69-72). Date of Publication: 1994","The esophageal carcinoma, a disease with bad prognosis (5-year survival 5%), is rare in Austria (incidence 2.2/100.000). Only 1 of 150 esophageal carcinomas is found as an early carcinoma (with a 5 year survival of 74%). The classical symptoms are dysphagia, retrosternal pain and weight loss. T1 tumors exhibit symptoms in 84%, too. A rapid diagnostic evaluation of these patients and a regular screening of persons at risk (alcohol and nicotine abuse, endobrachyesophagus, caustic or actinic stenoses, achalasia, celiac disease, Plumer-Vinson syndrome, tylosis, respiratory tract carcinomas) could improve the prognosis by detecting early stage tumors. The endoscopic examination with biopsy, brush cytology and intravital staining has the highest diagnostic accuracy. The staging of esophageal carcinomas should include endosonography and CT-scan, in some cases bronchoscopy. New therapeutic concepts should be based on their results.",,
"Tracking significant modules and key genes for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma based on differential modules",,"Zheng M.-L., Zhou N.-K., Luo C.-H.","Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics (2018) 14:12 Supplement Issue 5 (S1135-S1140). Date of Publication: 2018","Background: The exact molecular mechanism of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still unknown, and the prognosis of ESCC has not been significantly improved. Objective: To understand the molecular mechanism of ESCC, differential modules (DMs) and key genes were identified through conducting analysis on the differential co-expression network (DCN) based on the gene expression profiles of ESCC and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Materials and Methods: First, gene expression profiles of ESCC and PPI data recruiting and preprocessing were conducted; then, a DCN was constructed based on the gene co-expression and gene differential expression in ESCC; in the following, candidate DMs were mined from DCN through a systemic module searching strategy, and significance analysis was performed on candidate DMs to identify DMs; moreover, significant genes contained in the DMs were analyzed to identify the underlying biomarkers for ESCC. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to disclose the function of these DMs. Results: A total of 10,975 genes were obtained after comprehensively preprocessing on the gene expression profiles and PPI data. Then, a DCN with 915 nodes (1164 interactions) was built, and 45 seed genes were identified. In the following, four DMs that separately enriched in phenylalanine metabolism, nicotine addiction, phenylalanine metabolism, and B-cell receptor signaling pathway were identified, where module 1 and module 3 were all enriched in phenylalanine metabolism pathway. Furthermore, the most significant seed gene myeloperoxidase (MPO) was contained in all of the DMs. Conclusions: In this study, we successfully identified 4 DMs, three significant pathways, and a key gene MPO in ESCC, which might play key roles during the occurrence and development of ESCC and could be chosen as good indicators and therapeutic schedule for ESCC.",,
